# Food-Ordering-System
This project is a desktop application built using Java Swing (JFrame) that simulates a basic food ordering system. Users can browse available food items, add them to their order/cart, and finalize their order.

Features:
User-friendly GUI with JFrame components (buttons, lists, labels).

Menu display with multiple food categories.

Add, remove, and view selected food items in the order cart.

Calculate total price dynamically.

Simple order confirmation.

Basic error handling and input validation.

Purpose:
This project is designed as a learning exercise to practice Java GUI programming with Swing and event-driven programming concepts. It can be extended with database integration or networked ordering in the future.

Technologies Used
